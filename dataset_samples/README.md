This folder includes five synthetic patient records that were generated using [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea).  
These files are used for testing and integrating with a local [HAPI FHIR](https://hapifhir.io) server as part of our SMART on FHIR practicum project.

## How to Run

### 1. Start the HAPI FHIR server
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:v6.10.0
Once running, you can open the FHIR server in your browser at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/fhir
```
### 2. Upload the patient files
You can upload each file using:

```bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
  -d @<filename>.json \
  http://localhost:8080/fhir
Example:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" \
  -d @Alfredo17_Schroeder447_b6b4e499-72a7-b2a7-e2f8-44b972e87562.json \
  http://localhost:8080/fhir
```

### 3. Check that it worked
Open this URL in your browser:

```bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient
You should see "total": 5 in the response if all patients were uploaded correctly.
